# Vanilla Project

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a14a6b00-90bd-4f64-8386-4fb82ddcd050/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/vanilla-project/deploys)

This is the repository for https://vanilla-project.guide.


## Getting Started

It is required to have Ruby and Bundler installed.


### Installing

To install all dependencies run `bundle install`.


## Run Locally

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and it will serve the content on http://localhost:8080.


## Deployment

We use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for this site, so deploys happen automatically after merging PRs or pushing directly to the `master` branch.
Pull requests will automatically create a preview deployment, so that changes can be viewed in advance, too.


## Built With

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en)
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- :heart:
